Comments
########

The only comments supported by Jam are Single-line comments as most modern
editors have built-in shortcuts to comment out multiple lines, thus eliminating
the need for block comments.

::

    # This a single line comment

    # This how Multi-line
    # Comments will work

Comments are only compiled when compiling in debug mode and otherwise ignored.
